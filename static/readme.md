## Summary
This is my Jamstack site using Hugo, Bootstrap 4, and SCSS. I attempted to deploy this twice but the styles are not coming through.

This stack is new to me so I spent a lot of time getting acquainted with the technologies so no more time was spent trying to deploy again.

I understand that there is some code here that is probably not best practice but due to time and familiarizing with the stack it has not been completely refactored as of yet.

## Once you clone the repo:
cd into /hugo-site folder

then 

`npm install`

then

`hugo server -D
